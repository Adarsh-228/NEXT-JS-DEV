##Here i will be keeping the track of all my next-js learning 

## these are also my developement notes

if you see any error in a particular function or components there is specific page in NEXTJS that is error.tsx that will show a predefined message in ui wherever that error is popped up 

Also for loading animations although next is so fast you can barely see the loading animations but still 
Whenever we need to add a loading ui we can simply add a loading.tsx file
